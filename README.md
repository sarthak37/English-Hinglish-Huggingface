This code is training a T5 model to perform English to Hinglish translation. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what the code is doing:

Importing Necessary Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries from the transformers package1.

Loading the Model and Tokenizer: The code then loads the T5 model and its corresponding tokenizer1.

Loading the Dataset: The code loads a custom dataset from Hugging Face’s datasets library1.

Preparing the Training Data: The code prepares the training data by tokenizing the input and target sentences1.

Defining the Training Parameters: The code defines various training parameters such as the source and target languages, the maximum sequence length, and the number of training epochs1.

Preprocessing the Data: The code preprocesses the data by tokenizing the input and target sentences, adding the necessary prefixes, and handling padding and truncation1.

Training the Model: The code trains the model using the preprocessed data and the defined training parameters1.

Saving the Model: After training, the code saves the trained model1.

Testing the Model: Finally, the code tests the trained model by translating a sample sentence from English to Hinglish
